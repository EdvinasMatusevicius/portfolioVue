        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Edvinas Matuseviƒçius, and I'm currently living in Lithuania, Kaunas. Studied Interactive media and design in Plymouth Collage of Art and Design where I learned principles of UI design and tools too implement them. Later on I became interested in technical side of web development and started learning basics of programing, soon after I joined Kaunas Code Academy's full-stack course and successfuly finished it. Now I continue learning by working on my personal projects.</p>
